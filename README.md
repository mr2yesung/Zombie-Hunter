# Zombie Hunter

This game is inspired by PUBG: Battlegrounds and Vampire Survivors and developed using Godot 4.2. Before starting the game, players can choose their primary weapon (type of gun). There are two types of guns based on bullet speed: guns that use raycasting and guns that use projectiles. The game's zombies, which are the monsters, chase the player around the world, and the player earns points based on the number of zombies they defeat. Players can adjust graphics and sound settings, which are automatically saved to a file and loaded the next time the game is launched. The player's movements are implemented using a finite state machine, ensuring more organized and smooth behavior.
